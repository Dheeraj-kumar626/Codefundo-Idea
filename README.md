                                          	NATURAL DISASTER PREDICTION AND ITS MANAGEMENT

1 . AIM - To design a web application software which can do the following things:-
       I.  Prediction of a  Natural Disaster in the susceptible area.
       II. Appropriate disaster management strategies to save people in advance.

2.    MAIN IDEA - 

  Prediction:-
    Usually,  all the natural calamities are preceded by a specific set of climatic conditions which can be used to predict 
    the occurrence of the natural disaster in the future. In our software, we use the seismological data from the real-time 
    sensors over the different locations under observations and then process that data using the real-time algorithms and 
    predict the extent of destruction which can be caused by that disaster in future, the expected timing of the occurrence 
    of the disaster etc. For example -

          I. Prediction of Flood:- We take the satellite images of the oceans and the rivers and then compare these images with 
          the previously available images in our database using ‘Normalized Compression Distance ‘ concept of neural networks and 
          for better accuracy, we also use ‘ Convolutional Neural Networks ‘ concept. Seismological data will be received by our 
          software from the sensors and then we apply real-time algorithms like ‘Time reverse Imaging ’ to predict the extent and 
          the effect of the flood. A small working model will also be shown using a arduino sensor.

          II. Prediction of other disasters like Hurricanes , Drought , Landslides , Wildfire etc are dependent on the factors like 
          humidity in the atmosphere , temperature over a period, water-ground level , wind speed etc so these all the data will be 
          received by our software and then processed by the previous data and predict the chances the type of disaster what it can be.

          To increase the accuracy of the prediction of out software we train our model on some real data sets and observe its accuracy 
          rates . Our model will be a classifier algorithm based model if it predicts the chances of a specific type of disaster then 
          we will use the current climatic conditions as a data input for our algorithm to predict the time and level of magnitude if 
          the disaster. This would be done by the concept of a multi-variable regression algorithm.

II. MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES:-
	
In our software there will be login accounts of every person who has registered. As soon as our software detects any possibility of 
any upcoming  natural disaster it would send a message to the user to the mobile no. and alert him/her. It will show the portion of 
the area which can be affected by the disaster and show all the possible safe areas to move on the map. 
To the government officials our software will give a lot of time to do the following things for the upcoming calamity so that a lot 
of innocent lives can be saved.

Minimize casualties
Rescue victims on time
Offer first aid instantly
Evacuate people and animals to safe places
Reconstruct the damages immediately
